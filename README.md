# Employee-Attrition-Dashboard
The Employee Attrition Dashboard, built using PowerBI, helps organizations understand why employees leave. It uses charts and numbers to show important things like how many people left, average age, and more. By looking at these, bosses can make better choices to keep employees happy and make the company stronger.
